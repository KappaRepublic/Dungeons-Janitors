## Project Guidelines

To be discussed with the teams.

Follow these naming conventions when creating files within Unity:

1. Scripts - SCR_ClassName
2. Scenes - SCN_SceneName
- Further naming conventions to be discussed then added.

## Programming Guidelines

1. Variable Names
* Variables will follow camel case formating, for example `healthPoints` instead of `health_points`.
2. Function Names
* Function names will be stylized the same as variables, for example `decrementHealth`, and not `decrement_health`.
3. Class Names
* Classes will be all capitalized, using no underscores. For example `ClassName` is correct, `className` and `Class_Name` are not.
4. Class Headers
* When creating a class, add and edit the following header to the top of the class. When editing a class you haven't worked on before, be sure to add your name to the author(s) section so we can easily see who's worked on what class.
```
/*
* Class Name
* ==========
* 
* Created: date
* Base Class: (If applicable) Name of the base class.
* Author(s): Name of the people whom have worked on this file.
*
* Purpose: The purpose of this file.
*/
```

**README will be updated in future to comply to new changes within the project, as well as new information.**
